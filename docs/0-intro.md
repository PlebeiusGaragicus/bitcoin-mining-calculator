# The importance of open-source bitcoin development

Open-source software development allows for the democratization of technology - the process by which access to technology rapidly continues to become more accessible to more people.  As more humans begin to use Bitcoin as their monetary system and forgo legacy government-controlled systems, the need for wide understanding of this open monetary system becomes **necessary for human well-being.**

Humans need **tools** (internet infrastructure, apps, wallets, encoders/decoders, calculators) and **education** (explanations, tutorials, step-by-step instructions, analysis) in order to maintain and develop technology.

This tool aims to catalyze the understanding of this technology, and in-so-doing, enable future development of needed bitcoin systems.

No matter how small a step forward, each moment of progress encourages, motivates, excites, stimulates, energizes, inspires...

At this early stage of bitcoin adoption every useful line of code enables and every well-written article educates.

Advance the species towards continued growing by building with Bitcoin!
