This tool helps you decide when to invest in bitcoin mining equipment

```
"All models are wrong, but some models are useful." 
    -statistician George Box
```

This tool is for prospective bitcoin miners to understand the economics involved in bitcoin mining and to help aid in purchase decisions of bitcoin mining hardware - you can use it to calculate the potential earnings/costs of running any bitcoin mining equipment.  This project aims to be an open-source example of - and alternative to - bitcoin mining profitability calculators found online today (in 2022).  I hope to explain big concepts as I go and provide comments/documentation where possible to enable everyone's understanding of this technology.

This repository should revolve around teaching the ideas behind bitcoin mining and to encourage the smart, expansion of bitcoin mining - even at home.

The included code aims to be as easy to use as possible; with or without running your own Bitcoin archive node.

I am a pleb whose goal it is to inspire the next generation of coders to develop open-source tools for the world and, above all, to remind you that you don't have to be an expert in order to participate in this global bitcoin network.
